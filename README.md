# 🏢 Hall Management System

A Hall Management System built using Java and MySQL to manage hall-related operations through a structured and centralized application.
The system implements user authentication, student and employee information management, and hall service modules using CRUD operations and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles.

It integrates a Java Swing–based user interface with a relational database, ensuring efficient data storage, retrieval, and validation.
The project demonstrates practical use of Java programming, database connectivity, and modular software design.
